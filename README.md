# LiNote

LiNote is a Single Page application Used as a Note Management System for Creating and Saving Notes with built in Alerts.  
Built in MVC architectural pattern and based on Java Spring Boot in the Server Side, and React js on the Client Side.  
I used PostgreSQL as a database managed on the server, to store the data.
In addition, I implemented a feature of an Email alert with the use of Java Mail and Quartz Cron Scheduler.
An Automatic Email would be sent to the registered user, on the chosen Target Date at 8:00 AM .
